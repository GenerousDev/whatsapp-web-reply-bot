# How To Use It ?
1. Open `Chrome / Firefox`, then visit `web.whatsapp.com`

4. Done.
5. Now ask friend to send `@hello`

# F A Q
#### I think there're some bugs on your code!
Help me fix then :)
#### Can my account got banned ?
Hum, so you already know that Whatsapp does not allow Bots, right?
So ofcourse, Whatsapp will ban you forever if they discovery you are running a Bot on long-term. For a small test: Don't worry, go forward.
But, i can't guarantee that you are not getting banned.
#### Why you need chat for decoy ?
This bot needs it to make sure new message are read,
so by allowing bot to switch chat to other chat (which don't / won't has new message),
so the new message will not be `accidentally` read
#### So... what the limitation ?
A lot...
1. As this bot handling DOM directly, this bot can't process hundred message at once.
2. Can't start a message with unknown person.
3. Need install whatsapp on your phone, connect it on wifi, as long as you using this.
